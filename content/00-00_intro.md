# Welcome to 50 drops of JavaScript

## The reason why
This book collects 50 useful, unknown, underrated JavaScript functions or stuff discovered, used, and learned during JavaScript daily use.

Using JavaScript frameworks/libraries daily (like React, Vue, Angular), sometimes the perception of the power of the language and the basic functionalities provided by the JavaScript core could be lost.
I see that usually, I used to look at the framework documentation or look for a package in Npm for the system, array, and string functions instead of using core functionalities provided by the language.

While I wrote this book, I also wrote some scripts to better understand the behavior of the functions. You can find these examples here: https://github.com/roberto-butti/50-drops-of-javascript in the _examples_ directory.

### Requirements

The code used in this book is tested with **NodeJs version 18 (LTS)**.
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment, and you can obtain Node.js on the official https://nodejs.org/ website.

### Continuous release

I was thinking to print this book, but I think that is not so eco-friendly and a book about development could be improved daily in terms of spellchecking and the content and examples. So, I expect to adopt the same approach in the software with the CI/CD, with a continuous release of the book.

Releases:

- (WIP) release 1.0.0 (WIP not yet released): writing... ;
